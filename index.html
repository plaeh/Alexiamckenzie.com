<h1>In White</h1>

<q>A dented spider like a snow drop white
<br> On a white Heal-all, holding up a moth
<br> Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
<br> Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
<br> Portent in little, assorted death and blight
<br> Like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
<br> The beady spider, the flower like a froth,
<br> And the moth carried like a paper kite.

<br> What had that flower to do with being white,
<br> The blue prunella every child's delight.
<br> What brought the kindred spider to that height?
<br> (Make we no thesis of the miller's plight.)
<br> What but design of darkness and of night?
<br> Design, design! Do I use the word aright?</q>
